summary: FFI bindings for libdisarm
description: |
  Ruby FFI bindings for libdisarm, an ARM disassembler library.

  Disassembles ARM instructions to a data structure that makes it easy to
  access instruction parameters. The library also contains functions to print
  human-readable assembly code from instructions, and alongside the library a
  small disassembly tool is provided. Tested on ARMv4 code but should support
  instructions in ARMv5 and below. Thumb instructions are currently
  not supported.
